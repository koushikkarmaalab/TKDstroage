    <h1>Nanotechnology in Medicine - Nanoparticles in Medicine</h1>
    <p>The use of nanotechnology in medicine offers some exciting possibilities. Some techniques are only imagined,
        while others are at various stages of testing, or actually being used today.</p>
    <p>Nanotechnology in medicine involves applications of nanoparticles currently under development, as well as longer
        range research that involves the use of manufactured nano-robots to make repairs at the cellular level
        (sometimes referred to as <em>nanomedicine</em>). </p>
    <p>Whatever you call it, the use of nanotechnology in the field of medicine could revolutionize the way we detect
        and treat damage to the human body and disease in the future, and many techniques only imagined a few years ago
        are making remarkable progress towards becoming realities. </p>
    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-drug-delivery.html">Drug Delivery</a></h2>
    <p>One application of nanotechnology in medicine currently being developed involves employing nanoparticles to
        deliver drugs, heat, light or other substances to specific types of cells (such as cancer cells). Particles are
        engineered so that they are attracted to diseased cells, which allows&nbsp;direct treatment of those cells. This
        technique reduces damage to healthy cells in the body and allows for earlier detection of disease. </p>
    <p>For example researchers at North Carolina State University are developing a method to deliver cardiac stem cells
        to damaged heart tissue. They attach nanovesicles that are attracted to an injury to the stem cells to increase
        the amount of stem cells delivered to an injured tissue.</p>

    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-medical-diagnosis.html">Diagnostic
            Techniques</a></h2>
    <p>Researchers John Hopkins University are using&nbsp;<a href="covid-19-sensor.html">nanoimprint lithography </a>to
        manufacture a sensor that can detect covid-19 and other viruses that can be used with hand held testing device
        for quick reults. </p>
    <p>Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are using antibodies attached to carbon nanotubes in chips to
        detect cancer cells in the blood stream. The researchers believe this method could be used in simple lab tests
        that could provide early detection of cancer cells in the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>A test for early detection of kidney damage is being developed. The method uses gold nanorods functionalized to
        attach to the type of protein generated by damaged kidneys. When protein accumulates on the nanorod the color of
        the nanorod shifts. The test is designed to be done quickly and inexpensively for early detection of a problem.

    </h2>
    <p>Researchers at the University of Houston are developing a technique to kill bacteria using gold nanoparticles and
        infrared light. This method may lead to improved cleaning of instruments in hospital settings.</p>
    <p>Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder are investigating the use of quantum dots to treat antibiotic
        resistant infections. </p>

    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-wound-healing.html">Wound Treatment</a></h2>
    <p>Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have demonstrated a bandage that applies electrical pulses to a wound
        using electricity produced by nanogenerators worn by the patient.</p>
    <p>For trauma patients with internal bleeding another way to reduce the blood loss is needed. Researchers at Chase
        Western Reserve University are developing polymer nanoparticles that act as synthetic platelets. Lab tests have
        shown that injection of these synthetic platelets significantly reduces blood loss.</p>

    <h1 class="heading">[3] Describe the working-principles of Spin Coating and Lithography.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h1>Spin Coating</h1>
    <p>Spin coating is a procedure used to deposit uniform thin films to flat substrates. Usually a small amount of
        coating material is applied on the center of the substrate, which is either spinning at low speed or not
        spinning at all. The substrate is then rotated at high speed in order to spread the coating material by
        centrifugal force. A machine used for spin coating is called a spin coater, or simply spinner. </p>
    <p>Rotation is continued while the fluid spins off the edges of the substrate, until the desired thickness of the
        film is achieved. The applied solvent is usually volatile, and simultaneously evaporates. So, the higher the
        angular speed of spinning, the thinner the film. The thickness of the film also depends on the viscosity and
        concentration of the solution and the solvent. [1] A widely studied phenomenon in spin-coating is the coffee
        ring effect. </p>
    <p>Spin coating is widely used in microfabrication of oxide layers using sol-gel precursors, where it can be used to
        create uniform thin films with nanoscale thicknesses. [2] It is used intensively in photolithography, to deposit
        layers of photoresist about 1 micrometre thick. Photoresist is typically spun at 20 to 80 revolutions per second
        for 30 to 60 seconds. </p>
    <h1>Lithography</h1>
    <p>Microlithography and nanolithography refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring
        material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and
        features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography is one of these methods,
        often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for
        fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated
        photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.</p>
    <p>Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques
        are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution
        (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily
        for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of
        maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern
        is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans
        across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than
        photolithography.</p>
    <p>In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and
        nanolithographic technologies exist or are being developed, including nanoimprint lithography, interference
        lithography, X-ray lithography, extreme ultraviolet </p>

    <h1 class="heading">[4] Describe the working-principles of Wet Etching and Plasma Etching.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h1 style="padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify">Wet etching </h1>
    <p style=" padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; ">The
        first etching processes used liquid-phase (&quot;wet&quot;) etchants. The wafer can be immersed in a bath of
        etchant, which must be agitated to achieve good process control. For instance, buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF)
        is used commonly to etch silicon dioxide over a siliconsubstrate. Different specialised etchants can be used to
        characterise the surface etched. Wet etchants are usually isotropic, which leads to large bias when etching
        thick films. They also require the disposal of large amounts of toxic waste. For these reasons, they are seldom
        used in state-of-the-art processes. However, the photographic developer used forphotoresist resembles wet
        etching. As an alternative to immersion, single wafer machines use the Bernoulli principle to employ a gas
        (usually, pure nitrogen) to cushion and protect one side of the wafer while etchant is applied to the other
        side. It can be done to either the front side or back side. The etch chemistry is dispensed on the top side when
        in the machine and the bottom side is not affected. This etch method is particularly effective just before
        &quot;backend&quot; processing (BEOL), where wafers are normally very much thinner after wafer backgrinding, and
        very sensitive to thermal or mechanical stress. Etching a thin layer of even a few micrometres will remove
        microcracks produced during backgrinding resulting in the wafer having dramatically increased strength and
        flexibility without breaking. </p>
    <h1 style=" padding-top: 1pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify; ">Plasma etching </h1>
    <p class="s6"
        style=" padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; ">Modern
        VLSI processes avoid wet etching, and use <i>plasma etching </i>instead. Plasma etchers can operate in several
        modes by adjusting the parameters of the plasma. Ordinary plasma etching operates between 0.1 and 5 Torr. (This
        unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 pascals.) The plasma produces
        energetic free radicals, neutrally charged, that react at the surface of the wafer. Since neutral particles
        attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic. Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a
        lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be
        anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is
        maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be
        conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching. The source gas for the
        plasma usually contains small molecules rich <span class="s10">in chlorine or fluorine. For instance, carbon
            tetrachloride (CCl</span><span class="s11">4</span><span class="s10">) etches silicon andaluminium,
        </span>and trifluoromethane etches silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. A plasma containing oxygen is used to
        oxidize (&quot;ash&quot;) photoresist and facilitate its removal. <i>Ion milling</i>, or <i>sputter etching</i>,
        uses lower pressures, often as low as 10<span class="s8">−4 </span>Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with
        energetic ions of noble gases, often Ar<span class="s8">+</span>, which knock atoms from the substrate by
        transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one
        direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity.
        <i>Reactive-ion etching </i>(RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching
        (between 10<span class="s8">−3 </span>and 10<span class="s8">−1 </span>Torr). <i>Deep reactive-ion etching
        </i>(DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features. </p>

        much hydrogen chloride byproduct is present. (In fact, hydrogen chloride may be added intentionally to etch the
        wafer.) An additional etching reaction competes with the deposition reaction:</p>

        inadvertently etch the wafer, and takes place at lower temperatures than deposition from silicon tetrachloride.
        However, it will form a polycrystalline film unless tightly controlled, and it allows oxidizing species that
        leak into the reactor to contaminate the epitaxial layer with unwanted compounds such as silicon dioxide. VPE is
        sometimes classified by the chemistry of the source gases, such as hydride VPE and metalorganic VPE.</p>

        coefficient of substrate and grown layer should be similar.</p>

            template for crystal growth. The annealing step used to recrystallize or heal silicon layers amorphized
            during ion implantation is also considered one type of Solid Phase Epitaxy. The Impurity segregation and

        crystals. It was invented in the late 1960s at Bell Telephone Laboratories by J. R. Arthur and Alfred Y. Cho.
        MBE is widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, includingtransistors for cellular phones and
        WiFi. Molecular beam epitaxy takes place in high vacuum or ultra-high vacuum (10<span class="s13">−8</span>-
        10<span class="s13">−12</span>Torr). The most important aspect of MBE is thedeposition rate (typically less than
        3000 nm per hour) that allows the films to grow epitaxially. These deposition rates require proportionally
        better vacuum to achieve the same impurity levels as other deposition techniques. The absence of carrier gases
        as well as the ultra high vacuum environment result in the highest achievable purity of the grown films.</p>

            of ALD reactions use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with the surface of
            a material one at a time in a sequential, self-limiting, manner. Through the repeated exposure to separate
            precursors, a thin film is slowly deposited. ALD is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor

    <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Atomic Layer
        Deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition method in which a film is grown on a substrate by exposing its
        surface to alternate gaseous species (typically referred to asprecursors). In contrast to chemical vapor
        deposition, the precursors are never present simultaneously in the reactor, but they are inserted as a series of
        sequential, non-overlapping pulses. In each of these pulses the precursor molecules react with the surface in a
        self-limiting way, so that the reaction terminates once all the reactive sites on the surface are consumed.
        Consequently, the maximum amount of material deposited on the surface after a single exposure to all of the
        precursors (a so-called ALD cycle) is determined by the nature of the precursor-surface interaction. By varying
        the number of cycles it is possible to grow materials uniformly and with high precision on arbitrarily complex

            theme in nanotechnology. Many types of quantum dot will emit light of specific frequencies if electricity or
            light is applied to them, and these frequencies can be precisely tuned by changing the dots&#39; size, shape
            and material, giving rise to many applications. In the language of materials science, nanoscale
            semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are also sometimes
            referred to as artificial atoms, a term that emphasizes that a quantum dot is a single object with bound,
            discrete electronic states, as is the case with naturally occurring atoms or molecules.Quantum dots exhibit
            properties that are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. Their
            optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs (radius of 5–6 nm, for
            example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (radius of
            2–3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific
            colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD. Because of their highly tunable

        especially those with covalent bonds. For example, silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) quantum dots have been
        synthesized by using nonthermal plasma. The size, shape, surface and composition of quantum dots can all be
        controlled in nonthermal plasma. Doping that seems quite challenging for quantum dots has also been realized in
        plasma synthesis. Quantum dots synthesized by plasma are usually in the form of powder, for which surface
        modification may be carried out. This can lead to excellent dispersion of quantum dots in either organic
        solvents or water (i. e., colloidal quantum dots).</p><button onclick="showfullscreen();">Full Screen</button>

    <h1>Nanotechnology in Medicine - Nanoparticles in Medicine</h1>
    <p>The use of nanotechnology in medicine offers some exciting possibilities. Some techniques are only imagined,
        while others are at various stages of testing, or actually being used today.</p>
    <p>Nanotechnology in medicine involves applications of nanoparticles currently under development, as well as longer
        range research that involves the use of manufactured nano-robots to make repairs at the cellular level
        (sometimes referred to as <em>nanomedicine</em>). </p>
    <p>Whatever you call it, the use of nanotechnology in the field of medicine could revolutionize the way we detect
        and treat damage to the human body and disease in the future, and many techniques only imagined a few years ago
        are making remarkable progress towards becoming realities. </p>
    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-drug-delivery.html">Drug Delivery</a></h2>
    <p>One application of nanotechnology in medicine currently being developed involves employing nanoparticles to
        deliver drugs, heat, light or other substances to specific types of cells (such as cancer cells). Particles are
        engineered so that they are attracted to diseased cells, which allows&nbsp;direct treatment of those cells. This
        technique reduces damage to healthy cells in the body and allows for earlier detection of disease. </p>
    <p>For example researchers at North Carolina State University are developing a method to deliver cardiac stem cells
        to damaged heart tissue. They attach nanovesicles that are attracted to an injury to the stem cells to increase
        the amount of stem cells delivered to an injured tissue.</p>

    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-medical-diagnosis.html">Diagnostic
            Techniques</a></h2>
    <p>Researchers John Hopkins University are using&nbsp;<a href="covid-19-sensor.html">nanoimprint lithography </a>to
        manufacture a sensor that can detect covid-19 and other viruses that can be used with hand held testing device
        for quick reults. </p>
    <p>Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are using antibodies attached to carbon nanotubes in chips to
        detect cancer cells in the blood stream. The researchers believe this method could be used in simple lab tests
        that could provide early detection of cancer cells in the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>A test for early detection of kidney damage is being developed. The method uses gold nanorods functionalized to
        attach to the type of protein generated by damaged kidneys. When protein accumulates on the nanorod the color of
        the nanorod shifts. The test is designed to be done quickly and inexpensively for early detection of a problem.

    </h2>
    <p>Researchers at the University of Houston are developing a technique to kill bacteria using gold nanoparticles and
        infrared light. This method may lead to improved cleaning of instruments in hospital settings.</p>
    <p>Researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder are investigating the use of quantum dots to treat antibiotic
        resistant infections. </p>

    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-wound-healing.html">Wound Treatment</a></h2>
    <p>Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have demonstrated a bandage that applies electrical pulses to a wound
        using electricity produced by nanogenerators worn by the patient.</p>
    <p>For trauma patients with internal bleeding another way to reduce the blood loss is needed. Researchers at Chase
        Western Reserve University are developing polymer nanoparticles that act as synthetic platelets. Lab tests have
        shown that injection of these synthetic platelets significantly reduces blood loss.</p>

    <hr>
    <h1>Spin Coating</h1>
    <p>Spin coating is a procedure used to deposit uniform thin films to flat substrates. Usually a small amount of
        coating material is applied on the center of the substrate, which is either spinning at low speed or not
        spinning at all. The substrate is then rotated at high speed in order to spread the coating material by
        centrifugal force. A machine used for spin coating is called a spin coater, or simply spinner. </p>
    <p>Rotation is continued while the fluid spins off the edges of the substrate, until the desired thickness of the
        film is achieved. The applied solvent is usually volatile, and simultaneously evaporates. So, the higher the
        angular speed of spinning, the thinner the film. The thickness of the film also depends on the viscosity and
        concentration of the solution and the solvent. [1] A widely studied phenomenon in spin-coating is the coffee
        ring effect. </p>
    <p>Spin coating is widely used in microfabrication of oxide layers using sol-gel precursors, where it can be used to
        create uniform thin films with nanoscale thicknesses. [2] It is used intensively in photolithography, to deposit
        layers of photoresist about 1 micrometre thick. Photoresist is typically spun at 20 to 80 revolutions per second
        for 30 to 60 seconds. </p>
    <h1>Lithography</h1>
    <p>Microlithography and nanolithography refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring
        material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and
        features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography is one of these methods,
        often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for
        fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated
        photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.</p>
    <p>Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques
        are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution
        (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily
        for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of
        maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern
        is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans
        across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than
        photolithography.</p>
    <p>In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and
        nanolithographic technologies exist or are being developed, including nanoimprint lithography, interference
        lithography, X-ray lithography, extreme ultraviolet </p>

    <hr>
    <h1 style="padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify">Wet etching </h1>
    <p style=" padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; ">The
        first etching processes used liquid-phase (&quot;wet&quot;) etchants. The wafer can be immersed in a bath of
        etchant, which must be agitated to achieve good process control. For instance, buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF)
        is used commonly to etch silicon dioxide over a siliconsubstrate. Different specialised etchants can be used to
        characterise the surface etched. Wet etchants are usually isotropic, which leads to large bias when etching
        thick films. They also require the disposal of large amounts of toxic waste. For these reasons, they are seldom
        used in state-of-the-art processes. However, the photographic developer used forphotoresist resembles wet
        etching. As an alternative to immersion, single wafer machines use the Bernoulli principle to employ a gas
        (usually, pure nitrogen) to cushion and protect one side of the wafer while etchant is applied to the other
        side. It can be done to either the front side or back side. The etch chemistry is dispensed on the top side when
        in the machine and the bottom side is not affected. This etch method is particularly effective just before
        &quot;backend&quot; processing (BEOL), where wafers are normally very much thinner after wafer backgrinding, and
        very sensitive to thermal or mechanical stress. Etching a thin layer of even a few micrometres will remove
        microcracks produced during backgrinding resulting in the wafer having dramatically increased strength and
        flexibility without breaking. </p>
    <h1 style=" padding-top: 1pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify; ">Plasma etching </h1>
    <p class="s6"
        style=" padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; ">Modern
        VLSI processes avoid wet etching, and use <i>plasma etching </i>instead. Plasma etchers can operate in several
        modes by adjusting the parameters of the plasma. Ordinary plasma etching operates between 0.1 and 5 Torr. (This
        unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 pascals.) The plasma produces
        energetic free radicals, neutrally charged, that react at the surface of the wafer. Since neutral particles
        attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic. Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a
        lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be
        anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is
        maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be
        conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching. The source gas for the
        plasma usually contains small molecules rich <span class="s10">in chlorine or fluorine. For instance, carbon
            tetrachloride (CCl</span><span class="s11">4</span><span class="s10">) etches silicon andaluminium,
        </span>and trifluoromethane etches silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. A plasma containing oxygen is used to
        oxidize (&quot;ash&quot;) photoresist and facilitate its removal. <i>Ion milling</i>, or <i>sputter etching</i>,
        uses lower pressures, often as low as 10<span class="s8">−4 </span>Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with
        energetic ions of noble gases, often Ar<span class="s8">+</span>, which knock atoms from the substrate by
        transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one
        direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity.
        <i>Reactive-ion etching </i>(RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching
        (between 10<span class="s8">−3 </span>and 10<span class="s8">−1 </span>Torr). <i>Deep reactive-ion etching
        </i>(DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features. </p>

        micrometres per minute produce polycrystalline silicon, and negative growth rates (etching) may occur if too
        much hydrogen chloride byproduct is present. (In fact, hydrogen chloride may be added intentionally to etch the
        wafer.) An additional etching reaction competes with the deposition reaction:</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Silicon VPE may also use
        silane, dichlorosilane, and trichlorosilane source gases. For instance, the silane reaction occurs at 650 °C in
        this way:</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">This reaction does not
        inadvertently etch the wafer, and takes place at lower temperatures than deposition from silicon tetrachloride.
        However, it will form a polycrystalline film unless tightly controlled, and it allows oxidizing species that
        leak into the reactor to contaminate the epitaxial layer with unwanted compounds such as silicon dioxide. VPE is
        sometimes classified by the chemistry of the source gases, such as hydride VPE and metalorganic VPE.</p>

        substrate is indium phosphide (InP). Other substrates like glass or ceramic can be applied for special
        applications. To facilitate nucleation, and to avoid tension in the grown layer the thermal expansion
        coefficient of substrate and grown layer should be similar.</p>

            template for crystal growth. The annealing step used to recrystallize or heal silicon layers amorphized
            during ion implantation is also considered one type of Solid Phase Epitaxy. The Impurity segregation and

            beam epitaxy: </b>Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is an epitaxy method for thin-film deposition of single
        crystals. It was invented in the late 1960s at Bell Telephone Laboratories by J. R. Arthur and Alfred Y. Cho.
        MBE is widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, includingtransistors for cellular phones and
        WiFi. Molecular beam epitaxy takes place in high vacuum or ultra-high vacuum (10<span class="s13">−8</span>-
        10<span class="s13">−12</span>Torr). The most important aspect of MBE is thedeposition rate (typically less than
        3000 nm per hour) that allows the films to grow epitaxially. These deposition rates require proportionally
        better vacuum to achieve the same impurity levels as other deposition techniques. The absence of carrier gases
        as well as the ultra high vacuum environment result in the highest achievable purity of the grown films.</p>

            class="p">Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition technique that is based on the sequential
            use of a gas phase chemical process. ALD is considered a subclass ofchemical vapour deposition. The majority
            of ALD reactions use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with the surface of
            a material one at a time in a sequential, self-limiting, manner. Through the repeated exposure to separate
            precursors, a thin film is slowly deposited. ALD is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor
            devices, and part of the set of tools available for the synthesis of nanomaterials.</span></h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Atomic Layer
        Deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition method in which a film is grown on a substrate by exposing its
        surface to alternate gaseous species (typically referred to asprecursors). In contrast to chemical vapor
        deposition, the precursors are never present simultaneously in the reactor, but they are inserted as a series of
        sequential, non-overlapping pulses. In each of these pulses the precursor molecules react with the surface in a
        self-limiting way, so that the reaction terminates once all the reactive sites on the surface are consumed.
        Consequently, the maximum amount of material deposited on the surface after a single exposure to all of the
        precursors (a so-called ALD cycle) is determined by the nature of the precursor-surface interaction. By varying
        the number of cycles it is possible to grow materials uniformly and with high precision on arbitrarily complex
        and large substrates.</p>

        <span class="p">Quantum dots (QD) are very small semiconductor particles, only several nanometres in size, so
            small that their optical and electronic properties differ from those of larger particles. They are a central
            theme in nanotechnology. Many types of quantum dot will emit light of specific frequencies if electricity or
            light is applied to them, and these frequencies can be precisely tuned by changing the dots&#39; size, shape
            and material, giving rise to many applications. In the language of materials science, nanoscale
            semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are also sometimes
            referred to as artificial atoms, a term that emphasizes that a quantum dot is a single object with bound,
            discrete electronic states, as is the case with naturally occurring atoms or molecules.Quantum dots exhibit
            properties that are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. Their
            optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs (radius of 5–6 nm, for
            example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (radius of
            2–3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific
            colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD. Because of their highly tunable
            properties, QDs are of wide interest. Potential</span></h3>

        include transistors, solar cells, LEDs, diode lasers and second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, and
        medical imaging. Additionally, their small size allows for QDs to be suspended in solution which leads to
        possible uses in inkjet printing and spin-coating. These processing techniques result in less-expensive and less
        time consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Plasma
        synthesis has evolved to be one of the most popular gas-phase approaches for the production of quantum dots,
        especially those with covalent bonds. For example, silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) quantum dots have been
        synthesized by using nonthermal plasma. The size, shape, surface and composition of quantum dots can all be
        controlled in nonthermal plasma. Doping that seems quite challenging for quantum dots has also been realized in
        plasma synthesis. Quantum dots synthesized by plasma are usually in the form of powder, for which surface
        modification may be carried out. This can lead to excellent dispersion of quantum dots in either organic
        solvents or water (i. e., colloidal quantum dots).</p><button onclick="showfullscreen();">Full Screen</button>

    <h1>Nanotechnology in Medicine - Nanoparticles in Medicine</h1>
    <p>The use of nanotechnology in medicine offers some exciting possibilities. Some techniques are only imagined,
        while others are at various stages of testing, or actually being used today.</p>
    <p>Nanotechnology in medicine involves applications of nanoparticles currently under development, as well as longer
        range research that involves the use of manufactured nano-robots to make repairs at the cellular level
        (sometimes referred to as <em>nanomedicine</em>). </p>
    <p>Whatever you call it, the use of nanotechnology in the field of medicine could revolutionize the way we detect
        and treat damage to the human body and disease in the future, and many techniques only imagined a few years ago
        are making remarkable progress towards becoming realities. </p>
    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-drug-delivery.html">Drug Delivery</a></h2>
    <p>One application of nanotechnology in medicine currently being developed involves employing nanoparticles to
        deliver drugs, heat, light or other substances to specific types of cells (such as cancer cells). Particles are
        engineered so that they are attracted to diseased cells, which allows&nbsp;direct treatment of those cells. This
        technique reduces damage to healthy cells in the body and allows for earlier detection of disease. </p>
    <p>For example researchers at North Carolina State University are developing a method to deliver cardiac stem cells
        to damaged heart tissue. They attach nanovesicles that are attracted to an injury to the stem cells to increase
        the amount of stem cells delivered to an injured tissue.</p>

    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-medical-diagnosis.html">Diagnostic
            Techniques</a></h2>
    <p>Researchers John Hopkins University are using&nbsp;<a href="covid-19-sensor.html">nanoimprint lithography </a>to
        manufacture a sensor that can detect covid-19 and other viruses that can be used with hand held testing device
        for quick reults. </p>
    <p>Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are using antibodies attached to carbon nanotubes in chips to
        detect cancer cells in the blood stream. The researchers believe this method could be used in simple lab tests
        that could provide early detection of cancer cells in the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>A test for early detection of kidney damage is being developed. The method uses gold nanorods functionalized to
        attach to the type of protein generated by damaged kidneys. When protein accumulates on the nanorod the color of
        the nanorod shifts. The test is designed to be done quickly and inexpensively for early detection of a problem.

    <h1 class="heading">[3] Describe the working-principles of Spin Coating and Lithography.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h1>Spin Coating</h1>
    <p>Spin coating is a procedure used to deposit uniform thin films to flat substrates. Usually a small amount of
        coating material is applied on the center of the substrate, which is either spinning at low speed or not
        spinning at all. The substrate is then rotated at high speed in order to spread the coating material by
        centrifugal force. A machine used for spin coating is called a spin coater, or simply spinner. </p>
    <p>Rotation is continued while the fluid spins off the edges of the substrate, until the desired thickness of the
        film is achieved. The applied solvent is usually volatile, and simultaneously evaporates. So, the higher the
        angular speed of spinning, the thinner the film. The thickness of the film also depends on the viscosity and
        concentration of the solution and the solvent. [1] A widely studied phenomenon in spin-coating is the coffee
        ring effect. </p>
    <p>Spin coating is widely used in microfabrication of oxide layers using sol-gel precursors, where it can be used to
        create uniform thin films with nanoscale thicknesses. [2] It is used intensively in photolithography, to deposit
        layers of photoresist about 1 micrometre thick. Photoresist is typically spun at 20 to 80 revolutions per second
        for 30 to 60 seconds. </p>
    <h1>Lithography</h1>
    <p>Microlithography and nanolithography refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring
        material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and
        features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography is one of these methods,
        often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for
        fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated
        photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.</p>
    <p>Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques
        are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution
        (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily
        for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of
        maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern
        is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans
        across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than
        photolithography.</p>
    <p>In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and
        nanolithographic technologies exist or are being developed, including nanoimprint lithography, interference

    <h1 style="padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify">Wet etching </h1>
    <p style=" padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; ">The
        first etching processes used liquid-phase (&quot;wet&quot;) etchants. The wafer can be immersed in a bath of
        etchant, which must be agitated to achieve good process control. For instance, buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF)
        is used commonly to etch silicon dioxide over a siliconsubstrate. Different specialised etchants can be used to
        characterise the surface etched. Wet etchants are usually isotropic, which leads to large bias when etching
        thick films. They also require the disposal of large amounts of toxic waste. For these reasons, they are seldom
        used in state-of-the-art processes. However, the photographic developer used forphotoresist resembles wet
        etching. As an alternative to immersion, single wafer machines use the Bernoulli principle to employ a gas
        (usually, pure nitrogen) to cushion and protect one side of the wafer while etchant is applied to the other
        side. It can be done to either the front side or back side. The etch chemistry is dispensed on the top side when
        in the machine and the bottom side is not affected. This etch method is particularly effective just before
        &quot;backend&quot; processing (BEOL), where wafers are normally very much thinner after wafer backgrinding, and
        very sensitive to thermal or mechanical stress. Etching a thin layer of even a few micrometres will remove
        microcracks produced during backgrinding resulting in the wafer having dramatically increased strength and
        flexibility without breaking. </p>
    <h1 style=" padding-top: 1pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify; ">Plasma etching </h1>
    <p class="s6"
        style=" padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; ">Modern
        VLSI processes avoid wet etching, and use <i>plasma etching </i>instead. Plasma etchers can operate in several
        modes by adjusting the parameters of the plasma. Ordinary plasma etching operates between 0.1 and 5 Torr. (This
        unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 pascals.) The plasma produces
        energetic free radicals, neutrally charged, that react at the surface of the wafer. Since neutral particles
        attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic. Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a
        lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be
        anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is
        maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be
        conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching. The source gas for the
        plasma usually contains small molecules rich <span class="s10">in chlorine or fluorine. For instance, carbon
            tetrachloride (CCl</span><span class="s11">4</span><span class="s10">) etches silicon andaluminium,
        </span>and trifluoromethane etches silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. A plasma containing oxygen is used to
        oxidize (&quot;ash&quot;) photoresist and facilitate its removal. <i>Ion milling</i>, or <i>sputter etching</i>,
        uses lower pressures, often as low as 10<span class="s8">−4 </span>Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with
        energetic ions of noble gases, often Ar<span class="s8">+</span>, which knock atoms from the substrate by
        transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one
        direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity.
        <i>Reactive-ion etching </i>(RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching
        (between 10<span class="s8">−3 </span>and 10<span class="s8">−1 </span>Torr). <i>Deep reactive-ion etching
        </i>(DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features. </p>

        crystals. It was invented in the late 1960s at Bell Telephone Laboratories by J. R. Arthur and Alfred Y. Cho.
        MBE is widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, includingtransistors for cellular phones and
        WiFi. Molecular beam epitaxy takes place in high vacuum or ultra-high vacuum (10<span class="s13">−8</span>-
        10<span class="s13">−12</span>Torr). The most important aspect of MBE is thedeposition rate (typically less than
        3000 nm per hour) that allows the films to grow epitaxially. These deposition rates require proportionally
        better vacuum to achieve the same impurity levels as other deposition techniques. The absence of carrier gases
        as well as the ultra high vacuum environment result in the highest achievable purity of the grown films.</p>

            class="p">Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition technique that is based on the sequential
            use of a gas phase chemical process. ALD is considered a subclass ofchemical vapour deposition. The majority
            of ALD reactions use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with the surface of
            a material one at a time in a sequential, self-limiting, manner. Through the repeated exposure to separate
            precursors, a thin film is slowly deposited. ALD is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor
            devices, and part of the set of tools available for the synthesis of nanomaterials.</span></h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Atomic Layer
        Deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition method in which a film is grown on a substrate by exposing its
        surface to alternate gaseous species (typically referred to asprecursors). In contrast to chemical vapor
        deposition, the precursors are never present simultaneously in the reactor, but they are inserted as a series of
        sequential, non-overlapping pulses. In each of these pulses the precursor molecules react with the surface in a
        self-limiting way, so that the reaction terminates once all the reactive sites on the surface are consumed.
        Consequently, the maximum amount of material deposited on the surface after a single exposure to all of the
        precursors (a so-called ALD cycle) is determined by the nature of the precursor-surface interaction. By varying
        the number of cycles it is possible to grow materials uniformly and with high precision on arbitrarily complex
        and large substrates.</p>

        <span class="p">Quantum dots (QD) are very small semiconductor particles, only several nanometres in size, so
            small that their optical and electronic properties differ from those of larger particles. They are a central
            theme in nanotechnology. Many types of quantum dot will emit light of specific frequencies if electricity or
            light is applied to them, and these frequencies can be precisely tuned by changing the dots&#39; size, shape
            and material, giving rise to many applications. In the language of materials science, nanoscale
            semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are also sometimes
            referred to as artificial atoms, a term that emphasizes that a quantum dot is a single object with bound,
            discrete electronic states, as is the case with naturally occurring atoms or molecules.Quantum dots exhibit
            properties that are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. Their
            optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs (radius of 5–6 nm, for
            example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (radius of
            2–3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific
            colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD. Because of their highly tunable
            properties, QDs are of wide interest. Potential</span></h3>

        include transistors, solar cells, LEDs, diode lasers and second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, and
        medical imaging. Additionally, their small size allows for QDs to be suspended in solution which leads to
        possible uses in inkjet printing and spin-coating. These processing techniques result in less-expensive and less
        time consuming methods of semiconductor fabrication.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Plasma
        synthesis has evolved to be one of the most popular gas-phase approaches for the production of quantum dots,
        especially those with covalent bonds. For example, silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) quantum dots have been
        synthesized by using nonthermal plasma. The size, shape, surface and composition of quantum dots can all be
        controlled in nonthermal plasma. Doping that seems quite challenging for quantum dots has also been realized in
        plasma synthesis. Quantum dots synthesized by plasma are usually in the form of powder, for which surface
        modification may be carried out. This can lead to excellent dispersion of quantum dots in either organic
        solvents or water (i. e., colloidal quantum dots).</p><button onclick="showfullscreen();">Full Screen</button>

    <h1>Nanotechnology in Medicine - Nanoparticles in Medicine</h1>
    <p>The use of nanotechnology in medicine offers some exciting possibilities. Some techniques are only imagined,
        while others are at various stages of testing, or actually being used today.</p>
    <p>Nanotechnology in medicine involves applications of nanoparticles currently under development, as well as longer
        range research that involves the use of manufactured nano-robots to make repairs at the cellular level
        (sometimes referred to as <em>nanomedicine</em>). </p>
    <p>Whatever you call it, the use of nanotechnology in the field of medicine could revolutionize the way we detect
        and treat damage to the human body and disease in the future, and many techniques only imagined a few years ago
        are making remarkable progress towards becoming realities. </p>
    <h2>Nanotechnology in Medicine Application: <a href="nanotechnology-drug-delivery.html">Drug Delivery</a></h2>
    <p>One application of nanotechnology in medicine currently being developed involves employing nanoparticles to
        deliver drugs, heat, light or other substances to specific types of cells (such as cancer cells). Particles are
        engineered so that they are attracted to diseased cells, which allows&nbsp;direct treatment of those cells. This
        technique reduces damage to healthy cells in the body and allows for earlier detection of disease. </p>
    <p>For example researchers at North Carolina State University are developing a method to deliver cardiac stem cells
        to damaged heart tissue. They attach nanovesicles that are attracted to an injury to the stem cells to increase
        the amount of stem cells delivered to an injured tissue.</p>

            Techniques</a></h2>
    <p>Researchers John Hopkins University are using&nbsp;<a href="covid-19-sensor.html">nanoimprint lithography </a>to
        manufacture a sensor that can detect covid-19 and other viruses that can be used with hand held testing device
        for quick reults. </p>
    <p>Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute are using antibodies attached to carbon nanotubes in chips to
        detect cancer cells in the blood stream. The researchers believe this method could be used in simple lab tests
        that could provide early detection of cancer cells in the bloodstream.</p>
    <p>A test for early detection of kidney damage is being developed. The method uses gold nanorods functionalized to
        attach to the type of protein generated by damaged kidneys. When protein accumulates on the nanorod the color of
        the nanorod shifts. The test is designed to be done quickly and inexpensively for early detection of a problem.

    <h1 class="heading">[3] Describe the working-principles of Spin Coating and Lithography.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h1>Spin Coating</h1>
    <p>Spin coating is a procedure used to deposit uniform thin films to flat substrates. Usually a small amount of
        coating material is applied on the center of the substrate, which is either spinning at low speed or not
        spinning at all. The substrate is then rotated at high speed in order to spread the coating material by
        centrifugal force. A machine used for spin coating is called a spin coater, or simply spinner. </p>
    <p>Rotation is continued while the fluid spins off the edges of the substrate, until the desired thickness of the
        film is achieved. The applied solvent is usually volatile, and simultaneously evaporates. So, the higher the
        angular speed of spinning, the thinner the film. The thickness of the film also depends on the viscosity and
        concentration of the solution and the solvent. [1] A widely studied phenomenon in spin-coating is the coffee
        ring effect. </p>
    <p>Spin coating is widely used in microfabrication of oxide layers using sol-gel precursors, where it can be used to
        create uniform thin films with nanoscale thicknesses. [2] It is used intensively in photolithography, to deposit
        layers of photoresist about 1 micrometre thick. Photoresist is typically spun at 20 to 80 revolutions per second
        for 30 to 60 seconds. </p>
    <h1>Lithography</h1>
    <p>Microlithography and nanolithography refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring
        material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and
        features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography is one of these methods,
        often applied to semiconductor manufacturing of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for
        fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated
        photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.</p>
    <p>Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques
        are also used. Some, for example electron beam lithography, are capable of much greater patterning resolution
        (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily
        for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of
        maskless lithography, in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern
        is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans
        across a resist-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than
        photolithography.</p>
    <p>In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and
        nanolithographic technologies exist or are being developed, including nanoimprint lithography, interference
        lithography, X-ray lithography, extreme ultraviolet </p>

    <h1 style="padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; text-align: justify">Wet etching </h1>
    <p style=" padding-top: 6pt; padding-left: 6pt; text-indent: 0pt; line-height: 150%; text-align: justify; ">The
        first etching processes used liquid-phase (&quot;wet&quot;) etchants. The wafer can be immersed in a bath of
        etchant, which must be agitated to achieve good process control. For instance, buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF)
        is used commonly to etch silicon dioxide over a siliconsubstrate. Different specialised etchants can be used to
        characterise the surface etched. Wet etchants are usually isotropic, which leads to large bias when etching
        thick films. They also require the disposal of large amounts of toxic waste. For these reasons, they are seldom
        used in state-of-the-art processes. However, the photographic developer used forphotoresist resembles wet
        etching. As an alternative to immersion, single wafer machines use the Bernoulli principle to employ a gas
        (usually, pure nitrogen) to cushion and protect one side of the wafer while etchant is applied to the other
        side. It can be done to either the front side or back side. The etch chemistry is dispensed on the top side when
        in the machine and the bottom side is not affected. This etch method is particularly effective just before
        &quot;backend&quot; processing (BEOL), where wafers are normally very much thinner after wafer backgrinding, and
        very sensitive to thermal or mechanical stress. Etching a thin layer of even a few micrometres will remove
        microcracks produced during backgrinding resulting in the wafer having dramatically increased strength and
        flexibility without breaking. </p>

        unit of pressure, commonly used in vacuum engineering, equals approximately 133.3 pascals.) The plasma produces
        energetic free radicals, neutrally charged, that react at the surface of the wafer. Since neutral particles
        attack the wafer from all angles, this process is isotropic. Plasma etching can be isotropic, i.e., exhibiting a
        lateral undercut rate on a patterned surface approximately the same as its downward etch rate, or can be
        anisotropic, i.e., exhibiting a smaller lateral undercut rate than its downward etch rate. Such anisotropy is
        maximized in deep reactive ion etching. The use of the term anisotropy for plasma etching should not be
        conflated with the use of the same term when referring to orientation-dependent etching. The source gas for the
        plasma usually contains small molecules rich <span class="s10">in chlorine or fluorine. For instance, carbon
            tetrachloride (CCl</span><span class="s11">4</span><span class="s10">) etches silicon andaluminium,
        </span>and trifluoromethane etches silicon dioxide and silicon nitride. A plasma containing oxygen is used to
        oxidize (&quot;ash&quot;) photoresist and facilitate its removal. <i>Ion milling</i>, or <i>sputter etching</i>,
        uses lower pressures, often as low as 10<span class="s8">−4 </span>Torr (10 mPa). It bombards the wafer with
        energetic ions of noble gases, often Ar<span class="s8">+</span>, which knock atoms from the substrate by
        transferring momentum. Because the etching is performed by ions, which approach the wafer approximately from one
        direction, this process is highly anisotropic. On the other hand, it tends to display poor selectivity.
        <i>Reactive-ion etching </i>(RIE) operates under conditions intermediate between sputter and plasma etching
        (between 10<span class="s8">−3 </span>and 10<span class="s8">−1 </span>Torr). <i>Deep reactive-ion etching
        </i>(DRIE) modifies the RIE technique to produce deep, narrow features. </p>

        crystals. It was invented in the late 1960s at Bell Telephone Laboratories by J. R. Arthur and Alfred Y. Cho.
        MBE is widely used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, includingtransistors for cellular phones and
        WiFi. Molecular beam epitaxy takes place in high vacuum or ultra-high vacuum (10<span class="s13">−8</span>-
        10<span class="s13">−12</span>Torr). The most important aspect of MBE is thedeposition rate (typically less than
        3000 nm per hour) that allows the films to grow epitaxially. These deposition rates require proportionally
        better vacuum to achieve the same impurity levels as other deposition techniques. The absence of carrier gases
        as well as the ultra high vacuum environment result in the highest achievable purity of the grown films.</p>

            use of a gas phase chemical process. ALD is considered a subclass ofchemical vapour deposition. The majority
            of ALD reactions use two chemicals, typically called precursors. These precursors react with the surface of
            a material one at a time in a sequential, self-limiting, manner. Through the repeated exposure to separate
            precursors, a thin film is slowly deposited. ALD is a key process in the fabrication of semiconductor
            devices, and part of the set of tools available for the synthesis of nanomaterials.</span></h3>
    <p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Atomic Layer
        Deposition (ALD) is a thin film deposition method in which a film is grown on a substrate by exposing its
        surface to alternate gaseous species (typically referred to asprecursors). In contrast to chemical vapor
        deposition, the precursors are never present simultaneously in the reactor, but they are inserted as a series of
        sequential, non-overlapping pulses. In each of these pulses the precursor molecules react with the surface in a
        self-limiting way, so that the reaction terminates once all the reactive sites on the surface are consumed.
        Consequently, the maximum amount of material deposited on the surface after a single exposure to all of the
        precursors (a so-called ALD cycle) is determined by the nature of the precursor-surface interaction. By varying
        the number of cycles it is possible to grow materials uniformly and with high precision on arbitrarily complex
        and large substrates.</p>

        <span class="p">Quantum dots (QD) are very small semiconductor particles, only several nanometres in size, so
            small that their optical and electronic properties differ from those of larger particles. They are a central
            theme in nanotechnology. Many types of quantum dot will emit light of specific frequencies if electricity or
            light is applied to them, and these frequencies can be precisely tuned by changing the dots&#39; size, shape
            and material, giving rise to many applications. In the language of materials science, nanoscale
            semiconductor materials tightly confine either electrons or electron holes. Quantum dots are also sometimes
            referred to as artificial atoms, a term that emphasizes that a quantum dot is a single object with bound,
            discrete electronic states, as is the case with naturally occurring atoms or molecules.Quantum dots exhibit
            properties that are intermediate between those of bulk semiconductors and those of discrete molecules. Their
            optoelectronic properties change as a function of both size and shape. Larger QDs (radius of 5–6 nm, for
            example) emit longer wavelengths resulting in emission colors such as orange or red. Smaller QDs (radius of
            2–3 nm, for example) emit shorter wavelengths resulting in colors like blue and green, although the specific
            colors and sizes vary depending on the exact composition of the QD. Because of their highly tunable
            properties, QDs are of wide interest. Potential</span></h3>

        include transistors, solar cells, LEDs, diode lasers and second-harmonic generation, quantum computing, and
        medical imaging. Additionally, their small size allows for QDs to be suspended in solution which leads to
        possible uses in inkjet printing and spin-coating. These processing techniques result in less-expensive and less

        synthesis has evolved to be one of the most popular gas-phase approaches for the production of quantum dots,
        especially those with covalent bonds. For example, silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) quantum dots have been
        synthesized by using nonthermal plasma. The size, shape, surface and composition of quantum dots can all be
        controlled in nonthermal plasma. Doping that seems quite challenging for quantum dots has also been realized in
        plasma synthesis. Quantum dots synthesized by plasma are usually in the form of powder, for which surface
        modification may be carried out. This can lead to excellent dispersion of quantum dots in either organic
        solvents or water (i. e., colloidal quantum dots).</p><button onclick="showfullscreen();">Full Screen</button>
